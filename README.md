# Numerical Solution of 1D Schr√∂dinger equation for a Gaussian wave packet

## How to start?
Ensure that you are using Python 3.9 and the following libraries:
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/), a library used for data visualization, plotting and animating the packet. 
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/), that provides the mathematical ground to work in python, including arrays or constants (pi or exp).
- [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), used for the GUI creation.

If you are using `pip`, be sure to install them prior to using the code by inputing in the Command Prompt:
```
pip install <package_name>
```
As well ensure that the `python.exe` is in the Windows PATH (you can check this by running the command `python` on the cmd).

## Instructions of use
GUI is in development process. However, to run the code for each of the exercises run the the correspondent modules with each of the exercises.
