# wave_packet_sim

## Introduction
Repository containing the code and progress for the numerical methods lab of the Quantum Physics lab "Numerical Solution of 1D SchrÂ¨odinger equation for a Gaussian wave packet".

### Predependencies.
This code has been developed making use of alternative python libraries that need to be installed before using the code. 
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) `matplotlib` is a library used for data visualization, plotting and animating the packet. 
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/). `numpy` provides the mathematical ground to work in python, including arrays or constants (pi or exp). 
- 
Be sure to install them prior to using the code by inputing in the Command Prompt:
```
pip install <package_name>
```
